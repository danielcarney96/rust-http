# Rust http-server

This is a basic http-server built following the rust book.

## Future improvements

- Remove calls to `unwrap`, errors should be handled more gracefully.
- Edit buffer to handle arbitrary sizes.
- Look into different models for handling multiple requests (fork/join, async I/O).
- Write tests.
